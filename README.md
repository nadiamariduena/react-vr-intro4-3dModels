 ## WARNING!!

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Video issues related to adblocker üïµÔ∏è

- SOMETIMES the video takes more than 10 secs to load, its due to how long the bundle takes to build

- After completing the tutorial, I spent more than an hour trying to figure out "why?" the video didn't show,
  at the end I decided to test it in another browser and bingo, I realized that it was related to my adblocker

- MOZILLA seems to work perfectly (without adblocker of course) -->
